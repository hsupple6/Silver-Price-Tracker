# Silver-Price-Tracker
This project is a custom embedded system built around an ESP32 and an ILI9341 TFT display. It includes custom firmware for display control and logic, along with fully custom CAD-designed internal structure and external sheet metal enclosure, resulting in a complete hardware–software integrated device.
